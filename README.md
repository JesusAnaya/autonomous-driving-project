# PyTorch's implementation of the paper "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars"

## Introduction
This is the PyTorch implementation of the paper "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" by NVIDIA. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316).

This code is based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/PankajKarki/Self-Driving-Car) by Pankaj Karki. The original implementation is in TensorFlow.
## Conda requirements

To install the conda environment, run the following command: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Dataset from Sully Chen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view). It has a size of 2.3GB approximately.

## Training
To train the model, run the following command: `python train.py`.
